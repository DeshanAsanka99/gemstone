# Gemstone Classification with Deep Learning

This project is a deep learning-based image classification application that classifies different types of gemstones. The model is built using TensorFlow and Keras, while the web interface is created with Streamlit.

## Features

- Upload a gemstone image to classify it
- Shows the predicted class of the gemstone
- Displays a sample image from the training set of the predicted class
- Provides a confusion matrix to evaluate model performance
- Visualizes training history (accuracy and loss graphs)
- Displays model performance metrics such as accuracy and loss

## Technologies Used

- **TensorFlow/Keras**: For building and training the image classification model
- **Streamlit**: For creating the web interface
- **Pandas**: For handling data
- **NumPy**: For numerical operations
- **Matplotlib**: For visualizing training history and performance
- **Seaborn**: For plotting the confusion matrix
- **Altair**: For interactive visualizations

## Setup

### 1. Clone the Repository
